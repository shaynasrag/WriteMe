# attachment_tracker

## Introduction

### Backstory
This program was inspired by my sophomore fall university course, Attraction and Relationships, taught by Dr. Jennifer Hirsch. The goal of this program is to collect data, track progress and develop positive and healthy mindsets towards relationships.

This program is designed specifically with those who identify along the anxious attachment; however, since attachment theory exists on a spectrum, likely everyone would benefit from the introspection prompted by this program.

### Form
This program takes the form of Python's tkinter graphical user interface (GUI). It must be run on a local computer and requires packages that can be downloaded via ``pip`` and can be found in the ``import`` section of ``application.py``. Because of the static nature of the tkinter GUI, this version is now deprecated and I am currently working on a web-compatible version of this program.

## How to Use

### Purpose

This program is a mix of a therapeutic experience as well as an analytical, longitudinal collection of data. Some aspects of this program collect numerical representations of data, other parts prompt free-response submissions, and the remainder focus on mindfulness, introspection, and self-compassion. This is BOTH a self-help and an analytical tool.
